<p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language <em>legible</em>, <em>readable</em>, and <em>appealing</em> when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting <em>typefaces</em>, <em>point sizes</em>, <em>line lengths</em>, <em>line-spacing</em> (leading), and <em>letter-spacing</em> (tracking), and adjusting the <em>space between pairs of letters</em> (kerning). The term <b>typography</b> is also applied to the <em>style</em>, <em>arrangement</em>, and <em>appearance</em> of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information.

<p>Typography is the work of typesetters (also known as compositors), typographers, graphic designers, art directors, manga artists, comic book artists, graffiti artists, and, now, anyone who arranges words, letters, numbers, and symbols for publication, display, or distribution, from clerical workers and newsletter writers to anyone self-publishing materials.

Until the Digital Age, typography was a specialized occupation. Digitization opened up typography to new generations of previously unrelated designers and lay users. As the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous, the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished. So at a time when scientific techniques can support the proven traditions (e.g., greater legibility with the use of serifs, upper and lower case, contrast, etc.) through understanding the limitations of human vision, typography as often encountered may fail to achieve <strong>its principal objective: effective communication</strong>.

<h2 align="left"><i>Techniques & Color</i></h2>
<p>
There are many facets to the expressive use of typography, and with those come many different techniques to help with visual aid and the graphic design. <i>Spacing and kerning, size-specific spacing, x-height and vertical proportions, character variation, width, weight, and contrast</i>, are several techniques that are necessary to be taken into consideration when thinking about the appropriateness of specific typefaces or creating them. When placing two or more differing and/or contrasting fonts together, these techniques come into play for <i>organizational strategies</i> and <i>demanding attractive qualities</i>. For example, if the bulk of a title has a more unfamiliar or unusual font, simpler sans-serif fonts will help complement the title while attracting more attention to the piece as a whole.

<p>
In typesetting, <i>color</i> is the overall <i>density of the ink</i> on the page, determined mainly by the <strong>typeface</strong>, but also by the <strong>word spacing, leading, and depth of the margins</strong>. Text layout, tone, or color of the set text, and the interplay of text with the white space of the page in combination with other graphic elements impart a <i>"feel"</i> or <i>"resonance"</i> to the subject matter. With printed media, typographers also are concerned with <i>binding margins, paper selection, and printing methods</i> when determining the correct color of the page.
