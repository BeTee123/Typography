<p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language <em>legible</em>, <em>readable</em>, and <em>appealing</em> when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting <em>typefaces</em>, <em>point sizes</em>, <em>line lengths</em>, <em>line-spacing</em> (leading), and <em>letter-spacing</em> (tracking), and adjusting the <em>space between pairs of letters</em> (kerning). The term <b>typography</b> is also applied to the <em>style</em>, <em>arrangement</em>, and <em>appearance</em> of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information.
</p>
<p>Typography is the work of typesetters (also known as compositors), typographers, graphic designers, art directors, manga artists, comic book artists, graffiti artists, and, now, anyone who arranges words, letters, numbers, and symbols for publication, display, or distribution, from clerical workers and newsletter writers to anyone self-publishing materials.

Until the Digital Age, typography was a specialized occupation. Digitization opened up typography to new generations of previously unrelated designers and lay users. As the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous, the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished. So at a time when scientific techniques can support the proven traditions (e.g., greater legibility with the use of serifs, upper and lower case, contrast, etc.) through understanding the limitations of human vision, typography as often encountered may fail to achieve <strong>its principal objective: effective communication</strong>.

<h2 align="left"><em>The History of Typography</em></h2>
Although typically applied to printed, published, broadcast, and reproduced materials in contemporary times, all words, letters, symbols, and numbers written alongside the earliest naturalistic drawings by humans may be called typography. The word, <em>typography</em>, is derived from the Greek words &gamma;&nu;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf; typos "form" or "impression" and &gamma;&rho;&alpha;&phi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu; graphein "to write", traces its origins to the first punches and dies used to make seals and currency in ancient times, which ties the concept to printing.
<p>
The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the Mesopotamian cities of Uruk and Larsa, dating from the <time>second millennium B.C.</time>, may be evidence of type, wherein the reuse of identical characters was applied to create cuneiform text. Babylonian cylinder seals were used to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay. Typography also was implemented in the Phaistos Disc, an enigmatic Minoan printed item from Crete, which dates to between <time>1850</time> and <time>1600 B.C.</time> It has been proposed that Roman lead pipe inscriptions were created with movable type printing, but German typographer Herbert Brekle recently dismissed this view.
</p>
<p>
The essential criterion of type identity was met by medieval print artifacts such as the Latin Pruefening Abbey inscription of 1119 that was created by the same technique as the Phaistos Disc. The silver altarpiece of patriarch Pellegrinus II (1195&#45;1204) in the cathedral of Cividale was printed with individual letter punches. Apparently, the same printing technique may be found in tenth to twelfth century Byzantine reliquaries.Other early examples include individual letter tiles where the words are formed by assembling single letter tiles in the desired order, which were reasonably widespread in medieval Northern Europe.
</p>
<p>
Typography with movable type was invented during the eleventh-century Song dynasty in China by Bi Sheng (<time>990&#45;1051</time>). His movable type system was manufactured from ceramic materials, and clay type printing continued to be practiced in China until the Qing Dynasty.
</p>
<p>
Wang Zhen was one of the pioneers of <b>wooden movable type</b>. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down and the types could be replaced only by carving new pieces.
</p>
<p>
<b>Metal movable type</b> was first invented in Korea during the Goryeo Dynasty, approximately <time>1230</time>. Hua Sui introduced <b>bronze type printing</b> to China in <time>1490 AD</time>. The diffusion of both movable-type systems was limited and the technology did not spread beyond East and Central Asia, however.
</p>
<p>
A sixteenth century workshop in Germany showing a printing press and many of the activities involved in the process of printing. <b>Modern lead-based movable type</b>, along with the <b>mechanical printing press</b>, is most often attributed to the goldsmith <em>Johannes Gutenberg</em> in <time>1439</time>. His type pieces, made from a lead-based alloy, suited printing purposes so well that the alloy is still used today. Gutenberg developed specialized techniques for casting and combining cheap copies of letter punches in the vast quantities required to print multiple copies of texts. This technical breakthrough was instrumental in starting the <b>Printing Revolution</b> and the first book printed with lead-based movable type was the <b>Gutenberg Bible</b>.
</p>
<p>
Rapidly advancing technology revolutionized typography in the latter twentieth century. During the <time>1960s</time> some camera-ready typesetting could be produced in any office or workshop with stand-alone machines such as those introduced by <b>IBM</b> (see: <em>IBM Selectric typewriter</em>). During the mid-<time>1980</time>s personal computers such as the Macintosh allowed type designers to create typefaces digitally using <em>commercial graphic design software</em>. Digital technology also enabled designers to create more <em>experimental</em> typefaces as well as the practical typefaces of traditional typography. Designs for typefaces could be created faster with the new technology, and for more specific functions. <em>The cost for developing typefaces was drastically lowered, becoming widely available to the masses.</em> The change has been called the <strong><i>democratization of type</i></strong> and has given new designers more opportunities to enter the field.

<h2 align="left"><i>Techniques & Color</i></h2>
<p>
There are many facets to the expressive use of typography, and with those come many different techniques to help with visual aid and the graphic design. <i>Spacing and kerning, size-specific spacing, x-height and vertical proportions, character variation, width, weight, and contrast</i>, are several techniques that are necessary to be taken into consideration when thinking about the appropriateness of specific typefaces or creating them. When placing two or more differing and/or contrasting fonts together, these techniques come into play for <i>organizational strategies</i> and <i>demanding attractive qualities</i>. For example, if the bulk of a title has a more unfamiliar or unusual font, simpler sans-serif fonts will help complement the title while attracting more attention to the piece as a whole.
</p>
<p>
In typesetting, <i>color</i> is the overall <i>density of the ink</i> on the page, determined mainly by the <strong>typeface</strong>, but also by the <strong>word spacing, leading, and depth of the margins</strong>. Text layout, tone, or color of the set text, and the interplay of text with the white space of the page in combination with other graphic elements impart a <i>"feel"</i> or <i>"resonance"</i> to the subject matter. With printed media, typographers also are concerned with <i>binding margins, paper selection, and printing methods</i> when determining the correct color of the page.
</p>
<h2 align="left"><i>Principles</i></h2>
<p>
Three fundamental aspects of typography are <b>legibility</b>, <b>readability</b>, and <b>aesthetics</b>. Although in a non-technical sense <strong>legible</strong> and <strong>readable</strong> are often used synonymously, typographically <i>they are separate but related concepts</i>. Legibility and readability tend to support aesthetic aspects of a product.
</p>
<p>
<b>Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be distinguished from one another.</b> It is described by Walter Tracy as <i>"the quality of being decipherable and recognisable"</i>. For instance if a "b" and an "h", or a "3" and an "8", are difficult to distinguish at small sizes, this is a problem of legibility. Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of a font containing many characters which might be difficult to distinguish. Selection of case influences the legibility of typography because <b>using only upper-case letters (all-caps) reduces legibility</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Readability</b> refers to <i>how easy it is to read the text as a whole</i>, as opposed to the individual character recognition described by legibility. Use of margins, word- and line-spacing, and clear document structure all impact on readability. Some fonts or font styles, for instance sans-serif fonts, are considered to have low readability, and so be unsuited for large quantities of prose.
</p>
<p>
Text typeset example in <i>Iowan Old Style roman</i>, italics, and small caps, optimized at approximately ten words per line, typeface sized at 14 points on 1.4 &#120; leading, with 0.2 points extra tracking using an extract of an essay by Oscar Wilde <cite>The English Renaissance of Art</cite> <time>c. 1882</time>
</p>
<p>
<b>Legibility</b> <i>"refers to perception"</i> (being able to see as determined by physical limitations of the eye) and readability <i>"refers to comprehension"</i> (understanding the meaning). Good typographers and graphic designers aim to achieve excellence in both.
</p>
<p>
The typeface chosen should be legible. That is, it should be read without effort. Sometimes legibility is simply a matter of type size; more often, however, it is a matter of typeface design. Case selection always influences legibility. In general, typefaces that are true to the basic letterforms are more legible than typefaces that have been condensed, expanded, embellished, or abstracted.
</p>
<p>
However, even a legible typeface can become unreadable through poor setting and placement, just as a less legible typeface can be made more readable through good design.
</p>
<p>
Studies of both legibility and readability have examined a wide range of factors including <i>type size</i> and <i>type design</i>. For example, comparing serif vs. sans-serif type, roman type vs. oblique type, and italic type, line length, line spacing, color contrast, the design of right-hand edge (for example, justification, straight right hand edge) vs. ragged right, and whether text is hyphenated. Justified copy must be adjusted tightly during typesetting to prevent loss of readability, something beyond the capabilities of typical personal computers.
</p>
<p>
Legibility research has been published since the late nineteenth century. Although there often are commonalities and agreement on many topics, others often create poignant areas of conflict and variation of opinion. For example, Alex Poole asserts that no one has provided a conclusive answer as to which typeface style, serif or sans serif, provides the most legibility, although differences of opinion exist regarding such debates. Other topics such as justified vs. unjustified type, use of hyphens, and proper typefaces for people with reading difficulties such as dyslexia, have continued to be subjects of debate.
</p>
<p>
Legibility is usually measured through speed of reading, with comprehension scores used to check for effectiveness (that is, not a rushed or careless read). For example, Miles Tinker, who published numerous studies from the <time>1930</time>s to the <time>1960</time>s, used a speed of reading test that required participants to spot incongruous words as an effectiveness filter.
</p>
<p>
The Readability of Print Unit at the <i>Royal College of Art</i> under <i>Professor Herbert Spencer</i> with <i>Brian Coe</i> and <i>Linda Reynolds</i> did important work in this area and was one of the centres that revealed the importance of the <strong>saccadic rhythm of eye movement for readability</strong>in particular, the ability to take in (i.e., recognise the meaning of groups of) about three words at once and the physiognomy of the eye, which means the eye tires if the line required more than 3 or 4 of these saccadic jumps. More than this is found to introduce strain and errors in reading (e.g., Doubling). The <i>use of all-caps renders words indistinguishable as groups</i>, all letters presenting a uniform line to the eye, requiring special effort for separation and understanding.
</p>
<p>
These days, legibility research tends to be limited to critical issues, or the testing of specific design solutions (for example, when new typefaces are developed). Examples of critical issues include <i>typefaces for people with visual impairment</i>, <i>typefaces and case selection for highway and street signs</i>, or for <i>other conditions</i> where legibility may make a key difference.
</p>
<p>
Much of the legibility research literature is somewhat atheoretical—various factors were tested individually or in combination (inevitably so, as the different factors are interdependent), but many tests were carried out in the absence of a model of reading or visual perception. Some typographers believe that the <i>overall word shape</i> (<b>Bouma</b>) is <i>very important in readability</i>, and that the <i>theory of parallel letter recognition is either wrong, less important, or not the entire picture</i>. Word shape differs by outline, influenced by <i>ascending and descending elements</i> of lower case letters and enables reading the entire word without having to parse out each letter (for example, dog is easily distinguished from cat) and that becomes more influential to being able to read groups of words at a time.
</p>
<p>
Studies distinguishing between <i>Bouma recognition</i> and <i>parallel letter recognition </i> with regard to how people recognize words when they read, have favored parallel letter recognition, which is widely accepted by cognitive psychologists.
</p>
<p>
<h3 align="left">Findings of Legibility Research</h3>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Text set in lower case is more legible than text set all in upper case (capitals, all-caps), presumably because lower case letter structures and word shapes are more distinctive.</li>
<li>Extenders (ascenders, descenders, and other projecting parts) increase salience (prominence).</li>
<li>Regular upright type (roman type) is found to be more legible than italic type.</li>
<li>Contrast, without dazzling brightness, also has been found to be important, with black on yellow/cream being most effective along with white on blue.</li>
<li>Positive images (e.g., black on white) make handheld material easier to read than negative or reversed (e.g., white on black). Even this commonly accepted practice has some exceptions, however (for example, in some cases of disability, and designing the most effective signs for drivers).</li>
<li>The upper portions of letters (ascenders) play a stronger part in the recognition process than the lower portions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <i>aesthetic concerns in typography</i> deals not only with the careful selection of one or two <i>harmonizing typefaces</i> and <i>relative type sizes</i>, but also with <i>laying out elements</i> to be printed on a flat surface tastefully and appealingly, among others. For this reason, typographers attempt to observe <b>typographical principles</b>, the most common of which are listed below:</br>

<ul>
<li>Limit up to three colors, which should harmonize to each other and with the color of the paper and the dominant color(s) of the photo or graphics</li>
<li>Limit to two typefaces on a single page, which should "match"</li>
<li>Limit up to three fonts and sizes</li>
<li>Select the size of leading to be optimal and most pleasing to the eyes.</li>
<li>The number of different enhancements such as greater size, bold, italic fonts, capitalization, or different typeface, different color, as used for headlines and emphasized words inside the text block, should be limited and consistent, and be judiciously selected.</li>
<li>Avoid underlining like pest and should not be on top of another enhancement.<li>
<li>Text should be placed judiciously to lead the eye from one text cognitively natural way to the next text.</li>
<li>Multi-line headline should be segmented by phrases (no phrase should be split into two lines).</li>
<li>No widows and orphans (no beginning line of paragraph at the bottom of page, no last line of paragraph at the top of page).</li>
<li>Likewise no headline is at the page bottom.</li>
<li>The last line of a paragraph should flush with the preceding lines and not stand alone below a picture.</li>
<li>The printing elements should not be scattered in the hodgepodge fashion across the page, unless it truly conveys hodgepodge.</li>
<li>The letters V and W at the beginning of a paragraph line should extend a little to left of the vertical left flush line to give an optical impression of being flush with lines below.</li>
</p>
<p>
Readability also may be compromised by letter-spacing, word spacing, or leading that is too tight or too loose. It may be improved when generous vertical space separates lines of text, making it easier for the eye to distinguish one line from the next, or previous line. Poorly designed typefaces and those that are too tightly or loosely fitted also may result in poor legibility. <i>Underlining</i> also may reduce readability by eliminating the recognition effect contributed by the descending elements of letters.
