<h1 align="center">The History of Typography</h1>
Although typically applied to printed, published, broadcast, and reproduced materials in contemporary times, all words, letters, symbols, and numbers written alongside the earliest naturalistic drawings by humans may be called typography. The word, <em>typography</em>, is derived from the Greek words &gamma;&nu;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf; typos "form" or "impression" and &gamma;&rho;&alpha;&phi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu; graphein "to write", traces its origins to the first punches and dies used to make seals and currency in ancient times, which ties the concept to printing.
<p>
The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the Mesopotamian cities of Uruk and Larsa, dating from the <time>second millennium B.C.</time>, may be evidence of type, wherein the reuse of identical characters was applied to create cuneiform text. Babylonian cylinder seals were used to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay. Typography also was implemented in the Phaistos Disc, an enigmatic Minoan printed item from Crete, which dates to between <time>1850</time> and <time>1600 B.C.</time> It has been proposed that Roman lead pipe inscriptions were created with movable type printing, but German typographer Herbert Brekle recently dismissed this view.
</p>
<p>
The essential criterion of type identity was met by medieval print artifacts such as the Latin Pruefening Abbey inscription of 1119 that was created by the same technique as the Phaistos Disc. The silver altarpiece of patriarch Pellegrinus II (1195&#45;1204) in the cathedral of Cividale was printed with individual letter punches. Apparently, the same printing technique may be found in tenth to twelfth century Byzantine reliquaries.Other early examples include individual letter tiles where the words are formed by assembling single letter tiles in the desired order, which were reasonably widespread in medieval Northern Europe.

<p>
Typography with movable type was invented during the eleventh-century Song dynasty in China by Bi Sheng (<time>990&#45;1051</time>). His movable type system was manufactured from ceramic materials, and clay type printing continued to be practiced in China until the Qing Dynasty.

Wang Zhen was one of the pioneers of <b>wooden movable type</b>. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down and the types could be replaced only by carving new pieces.
</p>
<p>
<b>Metal movable type</b> was first invented in Korea during the Goryeo Dynasty, approximately <time>1230</time>. Hua Sui introduced <b>bronze type printing</b> to China in <time>1490 AD</time>. The diffusion of both movable-type systems was limited and the technology did not spread beyond East and Central Asia, however.

A sixteenth century workshop in Germany showing a printing press and many of the activities involved in the process of printing. <b>Modern lead-based movable type</b>, along with the <b>mechanical printing press</b>, is most often attributed to the goldsmith <em>Johannes Gutenberg</em> in <time>1439</time>. His type pieces, made from a lead-based alloy, suited printing purposes so well that the alloy is still used today. Gutenberg developed specialized techniques for casting and combining cheap copies of letter punches in the vast quantities required to print multiple copies of texts. This technical breakthrough was instrumental in starting the <b>Printing Revolution</b> and the first book printed with lead-based movable type was the <b>Gutenberg Bible</b>.

<p>
Rapidly advancing technology revolutionized typography in the latter twentieth century. During the <time>1960s</time> some camera-ready typesetting could be produced in any office or workshop with stand-alone machines such as those introduced by <b>IBM</b> (see: <em>IBM Selectric typewriter</em>). During the mid-<time>1980</time>s personal computers such as the Macintosh allowed type designers to create typefaces digitally using <em>commercial graphic design software</em>. Digital technology also enabled designers to create more <em>experimental</em> typefaces as well as the practical typefaces of traditional typography. Designs for typefaces could be created faster with the new technology, and for more specific functions. <em>The cost for developing typefaces was drastically lowered, becoming widely available to the masses.</em> The change has been called the <strong><i>democratization of type</i></strong> and has given new designers more opportunities to enter the field.
