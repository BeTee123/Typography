<h1> Techniques & Color</h1>
<p>
There are many facets to the expressive use of typography, and with those come many different techniques to help with visual aid and the graphic design. <i>Spacing and kerning, size-specific spacing, x-height and vertical proportions, character variation, width, weight, and contrast</i>, are several techniques that are necessary to be taken into consideration when thinking about the appropriateness of specific typefaces or creating them. When placing two or more differing and/or contrasting fonts together, these techniques come into play for <i>organizational strategies</i> and <i>demanding attractive qualities</i>. For example, if the bulk of a title has a more unfamiliar or unusual font, simpler sans-serif fonts will help complement the title while attracting more attention to the piece as a whole.

In typesetting, <i>color</i> is the overall <i>density of the ink</i> on the page, determined mainly by the <strong>typeface</strong>, but also by the <strong>word spacing, leading, and depth of the margins</strong>. Text layout, tone, or color of the set text, and the interplay of text with the white space of the page in combination with other graphic elements impart a <i>"feel"</i> or <i>"resonance"</i> to the subject matter. With printed media, typographers also are concerned with <i>binding margins, paper selection, and printing methods</i> when determining the correct color of the page.
